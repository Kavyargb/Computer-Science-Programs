To calculate the factorial of a number, you can use Python’s built-in functions for real numbers, and for complex numbers, you can use the Gamma function (`scipy.special.gamma`). The factorial of a complex number is defined as \( \Gamma(n + 1) \), where \( \Gamma \) is the Gamma function.

Here’s how you can implement a program to compute the factorial of both real and complex numbers:

1. **For real numbers**, you can use a simple iterative or recursive method.
2. **For complex numbers**, you can use the Gamma function from `scipy`.

First, make sure you have the `scipy` library installed:

```bash
pip install scipy
```

Here’s the complete Python program:

```python
import scipy.special
import cmath

def factorial_real(n):
    """Compute the factorial of a non-negative integer n."""
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def factorial_complex(z):
    """Compute the factorial of a complex number z using the Gamma function."""
    return scipy.special.gamma(z + 1)

# Input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a number (real or complex, e.g., 5 or 3+4j): ")

# Try to convert the input into a complex number
try:
    number = complex(user_input)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
else:
    if number.imag == 0:  # Check if the number is real
        number = int(number.real)
        if number < 0:
            print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.")
        else:
            print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial_real(number)}.")
    else:
        print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial_complex(number)}.")
```

### How It Works:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes user input and tries to convert it into a complex number.
2. **Real Numbers**:
   - Uses a function `factorial_real` to compute the factorial of non-negative integers.
   - For non-negative integers, it computes the factorial using a loop.
3. **Complex Numbers**:
   - Uses the `scipy.special.gamma` function to compute the Gamma function, which is used to find the factorial of a complex number.
4. **Output**: Depending on whether the input is a real or complex number, the program prints the factorial or informs the user that the factorial of a negative number is not defined.

### Example Usage:
- **Real Number**: Input `5` and the output will be `The factorial of 5 is 120.`
- **Complex Number**: Input `3+4j` and the output will be something like `The factorial of (3+4j) is (9.557260855514974-32.48293407649355j).`

This program effectively handles both real and complex numbers and uses appropriate methods to compute their factorials.

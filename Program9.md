# Program to print the product of even and odd numbers separately from 1 to 10
Hereâ€™s a Python program to print the product of even and odd numbers separately from 1 to 10:

## Code:

```python
# Function to calculate the product of even and odd numbers from 1 to 10
def product_of_even_and_odd():
    even_product = 1
    odd_product = 1
    
    for i in range(1, 11):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_product *= i
        else:
            odd_product *= i
            
    return even_product, odd_product

# Call the function and print the results
even_product, odd_product = product_of_even_and_odd()
print("The product of even numbers from 1 to 10 is:", even_product)
print("The product of odd numbers from 1 to 10 is:", odd_product)
```

## Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `even_product` is initialized to 1 to store the product of even numbers.
   - `odd_product` is initialized to 1 to store the product of odd numbers.
   
2. **Loop**: The `for` loop iterates through the numbers from 1 to 10.
   - If the number is even (`i % 2 == 0`), it multiplies `even_product` by the number.
   - If the number is odd, it multiplies `odd_product` by the number.

3. **Output**: The products of even and odd numbers are returned and printed.

We can calculate the product of even and odd numbers from 1 to 10 using mathematical properties. Here's how We can approach it:

### For Even Numbers:
The even numbers from 1 to 10 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
The product of the first \( n \) even numbers can be written as:

\[
\text{Product of evens} = 2 \times 4 \times 6 \times 8 \times 10 = 2^5 \times (1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Product of evens} = 2^5 \times 5! = 32 \times 120 = 3840
\]

### For Odd Numbers:
The odd numbers from 1 to 10 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
The product of the first \( n \) odd numbers doesn't have a simple formula, so we calculate it directly:

\[
\text{Product of odds} = 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 = 945
\]

### Python Code:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate product of even and odd numbers using formulas
def product_of_even_and_odd():
    # Even product: 2^5 * 5!
    even_product = (2 ** 5) * math.factorial(5)
    
    # Odd product: 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 (calculated directly)
    odd_product = 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9
    
    return even_product, odd_product

# Call the function and print the results
even_product, odd_product = product_of_even_and_odd()
print("The product of even numbers from 1 to 10 is:", even_product)
print("The product of odd numbers from 1 to 10 is:", odd_product)
```

### Output:
- **Product of even numbers**: \( 3840 \)
- **Product of odd numbers**: \( 945 \)

### Explanation:
1. **Even Product**: We use the mathematical expression \( 2^5 \times 5! \) to calculate the product of even numbers.
2. **Odd Product**: The odd numbers are multiplied directly because there is no simpler formula for their product.
3. **Factorial**: The `math.factorial(5)` computes \( 5! = 120 \), used for even product calculation.

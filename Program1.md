### 1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - The program needs to determine whether a given number is even or odd.
   - Even numbers are divisible by 2 with no remainder (e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc.).
   - Odd numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, etc.).

### 2. **Planning the Solution**
   - Get input from the user.
   - Convert the input to an integer.
   - Use the modulus operator (`%`) to check the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
   - If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.
   - Display the result to the user.

### 3. **Writing the Code**
```python
# Step 1: Get input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Step 2: Check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
```

### 4. **Considering Edge Cases**
   - What if the user enters a non-numeric input? We might want to add input validation.
   - What if the user enters a very large number? We need to ensure that the program handles large integers.

```python
try:
    # Step 1: Get input from the user
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    
    # Step 2: Check if the number is even or odd
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is an even number.")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is an odd number.")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer.")
```
